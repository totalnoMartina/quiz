This is a quiz made by following a fellow coder through YouTube, as a beginner I have noticed practice is my best friend, so this project is solely for practice purposes. I believe I can make this so much better but thanks to this guy I have some basics, and even I did not do exactly like the respected fellow coder, still it has helped me loads to understand how to think when using Javascript.
